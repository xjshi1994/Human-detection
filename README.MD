# Human Detection

In this project, I implement the Histograms of Oriented Gradients(HOG) feature and a Two-Layer Perceptron(neural

network) for detecting human in 2D color images. And I don't use any built-in library functions for the following steps:

1. Convert color image into gray image

2. Use the Prewitt's operator

3. Compute the HOG feature

4. Design  a two-layer perceptron
